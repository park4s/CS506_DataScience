    "\n",
    "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that if you always switch that means the only time you lose is if it happened that the car was under the door you originally picked which has a 33% chance of happening. Meaning you win 2/3 of the time by choosing to switch instead of staying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is generally considered an unintuitive problem. People may think the probability is 50% of picking the car given in the end you have a choice between 2 doors. In order to break this suspicion we will test it out using what is called a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation where you just put a bunch of random points and count how many of them give you a winning position given your decisions."
